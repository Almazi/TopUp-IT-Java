# Assignment: Vacation Assignment Project

Build a client server application for online examination with timer, using java API, Features of application will be as follow:

•	This will be a client server application.

•	Here a Server can accept multiple client requests.

•	Server should send the exam instruction for each client.

•	Server will send different questions for each client.

•	Each question should be answered in a minute, if not question will be answered automatically with a default answer.

•	After answering the question or after one minute next question should be send by the server for every client.

•	After answering all questions server should display the result of all clients.

•	After the test if client want to close the application, server should disconnect that client only.

#Tips:
•	For client server application socket programming can be used.

•	For implementation of timer we can use multithreading

•	For question and answer we can use file I/O or Arrays.

•	For calculating the result we can match the result using string.

•	For any other operation it better to write all the code inside try-catch-finally block.
